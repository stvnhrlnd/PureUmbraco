# Pure Grid Layout
This project is a complete Visual Studio 2013 solution that demonstrates how to combine [Pure Grids](http://purecss.io/grids/) with the [Umbraco Grid Layout](https://our.umbraco.org/documentation/using-umbraco/backoffice-overview/property-editors/built-in-property-editors-v7/grid-layout). It comes with a SQL CE database so it *should* just run after downloading.

## What's Included
The [Umbraco package](https://our.umbraco.org/projects/website-utilities/pure-grid-layout) contains the following:
* Pure Grid Datatype
* Pure Grid Partial View

The Visual Studio project also contains an example document type, template, and content node.
